Gary Clark, Jr. Lyrics
"The Healing"

Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey...

I got something in motion
Something you can't see
It requires devotion
From those who truly believe
This is something you can't touch
This is something you feel
For some people its too much
For some people it heals

This music is my healing
This music is my healing
Lord knows I need some healing
'cause this world upsets me,
This music sets me free, yeah

We stand in formation
While they test and they see
They compile information
And try to make us believe
That there is something we can't touch
Something we'll never feel
When I feel like it's too much
This music always reveals
